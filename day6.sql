-- Functions 

/*

Functions in MySQL are predefined operations that can be used to perform calculations, manipulate data, 
and retrieve specific information. These functions make it easier to work with strings, numbers, dates, and more. 
Functions--- 1. Built-in functions (sum(),avg(),count()...)    
             2. User defined functions.

They are categorized as follows based on their functionality: 

1. String Functions
These functions are used to manipulate and process string data.

LENGTH(str): Returns the length of a string.

CONCAT(str1, str2, ...): Concatenates two or more strings.

UPPER(str): Converts a string to uppercase.

LOWER(str): Converts a string to lowercase.

SUBSTRING(str, start, length): Returns a substring from a string.


2. Numeric Functions
These functions perform operations on numeric data.

ROUND(number, decimals): Rounds a number to a specified number of decimal places.

FLOOR(number): Returns the largest integer less than or equal to a number.

CEIL(number): Returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a number.

ABS(number): Returns the absolute value of a number.


3. Date and Time Functions
These functions are used to manipulate and format date and time values.

NOW(): Returns the current date and time.

CURDATE(): Returns the current date.

DATE_FORMAT(date, format): Formats a date according to a specified format.

DATEDIFF(date1, date2): Returns the difference in days between two dates.


4. Aggregate Functions
These functions perform calculations on a set of values and return a single value.

COUNT(expression): Returns the number of rows that match a specified condition.

SUM(column): Returns the sum of a numeric column.

AVG(column): Returns the average value of a numeric column.

MAX(column): Returns the maximum value of a column.

MIN(column): Returns the minimum value of a column.


5. Control Flow Functions
These functions allow for conditional logic in SQL queries.

IF(condition, true_value, false_value): Returns one value if the condition is true and another value 
if it is false.

CASE: Provides a way to perform conditional logic in a more complex manner.


6. Conversion Functions
These functions convert data from one type to another.

CAST(expression AS type): Converts an expression to a specified data type.

CONVERT(expression, type): Similar to CAST, but with different syntax.


7. JSON Functions
These functions are used to work with JSON data types.

JSON_EXTRACT(json_doc, path): Extracts data from a JSON document.

JSON_ARRAYAGG(value): Aggregates values into a JSON array.



8. User -Defined Functions (UDFs)
MySQL allows users to create their own functions for specific tasks.

 -- Clauses {Where, Distinct, From, Order By, Group By, Having}
 
 /* 
 
 1. WHERE Clause
The WHERE clause is used to filter records in a table based on specific conditions. 
It is typically used with SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2  
FROM table_name  
WHERE condition;  

2. DISTINCT Clause
The DISTINCT clause is used to return unique values from a column by removing duplicates 
in the result set.

Syntax:

SELECT DISTINCT column1  
FROM table_name;  

3. FROM Clause
The FROM clause specifies the table or tables from which the data is retrieved. 
It is a mandatory part of the SELECT statement and can also be used with joins for 
combining data from multiple tables.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2  
FROM table_name; 

4. ORDER BY Clause
The ORDER BY clause is used to sort the result set in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order 
based on one or more columns.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2  
FROM table_name  
ORDER BY column_name [ASC|DESC];  

5. GROUP BY Clause
The GROUP BY clause groups rows with the same values into summary rows, 
often used with aggregate functions (e.g., COUNT, SUM, AVG).

Syntax:

SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)  
FROM table_name  
GROUP BY column1;

6. HAVING Clause
The HAVING clause is used to filter grouped data after the GROUP BY clause. 
It works similarly to the WHERE clause but is applied to aggregated results.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)  
FROM table_name  
GROUP BY column1  
HAVING condition;  

7. LIMIT (or FETCH or TOP) Clause
The LIMIT clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query. 
Different databases may use variations like FETCH or TOP.

Syntax (MySQL):

SELECT column1, column2  
FROM table_name  
LIMIT number_of_rows;  

8. JOIN Clause
The JOIN clause is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column.

Syntax:

SELECT columns  
FROM table1  
JOIN table2  
ON table1.common_column = table2.common_column;  

9. UNION Clause
The UNION clause is used to combine the results of two or more SELECT statements. 
Duplicate rows are removed by default.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2  
FROM table1  
UNION  
SELECT column1, column2  
FROM table2;  

10.INTO Clause
The INTO clause is used to insert query results into a new table or export data.

Syntax:

SELECT columns  
INTO new_table_name  
FROM table_name  
WHERE condition;  

11.CASE Clause
The CASE clause allows conditional logic in SQL queries, similar to an if-else statement.

Syntax:

SELECT column1,  
       CASE  
           WHEN condition1 THEN result1  
           WHEN condition2 THEN result2  
           ELSE result3  
       END AS alias_name  
FROM table_name; 

12. IN Clause
The IN clause is used to filter records based on a list of values.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2  
FROM table_name  
WHERE column_name IN (value1, value2, ...);  

13. BETWEEN Clause
The BETWEEN clause filters data within a specified range, inclusive of the boundaries.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2  
FROM table_name  
WHERE column_name BETWEEN value1 AND value2;  

14. LIKE Clause
The LIKE clause is used to search for a specified pattern in a column. Wildcards include % (any number of 
characters) and _ (a single character).

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2  
FROM table_name  
WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;  

15. EXISTS Clause
The EXISTS clause checks for the existence of rows in a subquery.

Syntax:

SELECT column1, column2  
FROM table_name  
WHERE EXISTS (subquery); 

16. AS Clause
The AS clause is used to provide an alias (temporary name) for columns or tables, 
improving query readability.

Syntax:

SELECT column_name AS alias_name  
FROM table_name;

-- 7. LIMIT (or FETCH or TOP) Clause

/*

In MySQL, the LIMIT clause is used to restrict the number of rows returned by a query. 
Unlike some other SQL databases (e.g., SQL Server or PostgreSQL) that use TOP or FETCH, 
MySQL exclusively supports LIMIT. 

Syntax for LIMIT

SELECT column1, column2, ...
FROM table_name
LIMIT [offset,] row_count;

Key Components

1. row_count: Specifies the number of rows to return.
2. offset (optional): Specifies the starting point from which rows are returned. If omitted, 
the default is 0 (start from the first row).
3. LIMIT: Used to specify the maximum number of records to return.
4. Using LIMIT with a comma: An alternative way to specify both the offset and the limit in a single clause.
5. ROW_COUNT(): While not directly applicable, you can use SQL_CALC_FOUND_ROWS and FOUND_ROWS() to get the 
total count of rows.

-- Mysql Alias

/*

In MySQL, an alias is a temporary name assigned to a table or a column for the duration of a query
(within the scope of a query). Aliases are primarily used to enhance the readability and clarity of 
SQL statements, making it easier for users to understand the purpose of the data being retrieved or manipulated.

Key Points about MySQL Aliases:

1. Temporary Nature: 
Aliases exist only for the duration of the query. Once the query execution is complete, 
the alias ceases to exist.

2. Improved Readability: 
By using aliases, you can simplify complex column names or provide more meaningful names 
that better describe the data. This is particularly useful when dealing with long or complicated column names.

Syntax:

For column aliases, the syntax is:

SELECT column_name AS alias_name
FROM table_name;

For table aliases, the syntax is:

SELECT column_name
FROM table_name AS alias_name;

3. Usage in Queries: 
Aliases can be used in various SQL statements, including SELECT, UPDATE, and DELETE. 
They can also be used in conjunction with aggregate functions, joins, and subqueries.

4. No Impact on Database Structure: 
Using an alias does not change the actual table or column names in the database; 
it only affects how they are referenced in the query.

 -- Operators
 /*
 In MySQL, operators are special symbols or keywords that are used to perform operations on one or more 
 operands(values or variables). Operators are fundamental to constructing SQL queries, as they allow 
 you to manipulate data, compare values, and perform calculations. MySQL supports several types of 
 operators, which can be categorized as follows:

-- Bitwise operators

/*
Get Binary Number -

Binary of 5 is - 0101
Binary of 3 is - 0011

Common Bitwise Operators in MySQL
AND (&): Compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number with bits set to 1 only where both bits are 1.
OR (|): Compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number with bits set to 1 where at least one of the bits
is 1.
XOR (^): Compares each bit of two numbers and returns a new number with bits set to 1 where the bits are different.
NOT (~): Inverts the bits of a number.
Left Shift (<<): Shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions.
Right Shift (>>): Shifts the bits of a number to the right by a specified number of positions.

Bitwise operators can be useful in various scenarios, such as:

1. Flags and Permissions: Using bitwise operations to manage user permissions or feature flags.
2. Data Compression: Storing multiple boolean values in a single integer.
3. Efficient Calculations: Performing low-level data manipulation or optimizations.

Let's say we have a table called users that stores user permissions as a bitmask.
Each permission corresponds to a specific bit in an integer:

1 (0001) - Read permission
2 (0010) - Write permission
4 (0100) - Execute permission
8 (1000) - Delete permission
