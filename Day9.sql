/*
In MySQL, joins are used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related 
column between them. Joins allow you to retrieve data from multiple tables in a single 
query, making it easier to work with relational databases.

1. INNER JOIN:
   - Definition: The INNER JOIN keyword selects records that have matching values in both tables.
   - Purpose: To retrieve only the rows where there is a match in both tables, effectively filtering out 
   non-matching rows.
   
   - Example:
     SELECT a.EmployeeID, a.Name, b.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees a
     INNER JOIN Departments b ON a.DepartmentID = b.DepartmentID;

2. LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):
   - Definition: The LEFT JOIN keyword returns all records from the left table and the matched records from 
   the right table.
   
   - Purpose: To retrieve all records from the left table regardless of whether there is a match in the right 
   table, allowing for NULL values in the result set for non-matching rows.
   
   - Example:
     SELECT a.EmployeeID, a.Name, b.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees a
     LEFT JOIN Departments b ON a.DepartmentID = b.DepartmentID;

3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):
   - Definition: The RIGHT JOIN keyword returns all records from the right table and the matched records from 
   the left table.
   
   - Purpose: To retrieve all records from the right table regardless of whether there is a match in the left 
   table, allowing for NULL values in the result set for non-matching rows.
   
   - Example:
     SELECT a.EmployeeID, a.Name, b.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees a
     RIGHT JOIN Departments b ON a.DepartmentID = b.DepartmentID;

4. FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):
   - Definition: The FULL JOIN keyword returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table 
   records.
   
   - Purpose: To retrieve all records from both tables, including those that do not have matches in either table. 
   MySQL does not support FULL JOIN directly, but it can be simulated using a combination of LEFT JOIN and 
   RIGHT JOIN with a UNION.
   
   - Example:
     SELECT a.EmployeeID, a.Name, b.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees a
     LEFT JOIN Departments b ON a.DepartmentID = b.DepartmentID
     UNION
     SELECT a.EmployeeID, a.Name, b.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees a
     RIGHT JOIN Departments b ON a.DepartmentID = b.DepartmentID;

5. LEFT EXCLUSIVE JOIN:
   - Definition: This is not a standard SQL join type, but it can be simulated by using a LEFT JOIN and 
   filtering out the matched records from the right table.
   
   - Purpose: To retrieve records from the left table that do not have corresponding records in the right table.
   
   - Example:
     SELECT a.EmployeeID, a.Name
     FROM Employees a
     LEFT JOIN Departments b ON a.DepartmentID = b.DepartmentID
     WHERE b.DepartmentID IS NULL;

6. RIGHT EXCLUSIVE JOIN:
   - Definition: Similar to the left exclusive join, this is not a standard SQL join type but can be simulated 
   using a RIGHT JOIN and filtering out the matched records from the left table.
   
   - Purpose: To retrieve records from the right table that do not have corresponding records in the left table.
   
   - Example:
     SELECT b.DepartmentID, b.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees a
     RIGHT JOIN Departments b ON a.DepartmentID = b.DepartmentID
     WHERE a.EmployeeID IS NULL;

7. CROSS JOIN:
   - Definition: The CROSS JOIN keyword returns the Cartesian product of both tables, meaning it combines 
   every row of the first table with every row of the second table.
   
   - Purpose: To generate a combination of all records from both tables, which can be useful in certain 
   scenarios but may result in a large number of rows in the result set.
   
   - Example:
     SELECT a.EmployeeID, b.DepartmentName
     FROM Employees a
     CROSS JOIN Departments b;

8. SELF JOIN:
   - Definition: A SELF JOIN is a regular join but the table is joined with itself.
   
   - Purpose: To compare rows within the same table, such as finding hierarchical relationships or related 
   data within the same dataset.
   - Example:
     SELECT a.EmployeeID, a.Name, b.Name AS ManagerName
     FROM Employees a
     INNER JOIN Employees b ON a.ManagerID = b.EmployeeID;

In summary, joins are a powerful feature in SQL that allow you to combine data from multiple tables based on 
relationships between them. Understanding how to use different types of joins effectively is crucial for 
querying relational databases.

/*
Subqueries:

Definition:
A subquery, also known as a nested query or inner query, is a query embedded within another SQL query. 
It is enclosed in parentheses and can be used in various clauses such as SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE. 
Subqueries can return a single value, a single row, or a set of rows.

Purpose:
Subqueries are used to perform operations that require multiple steps or to filter results based on the 
results of another query. They can simplify complex queries by breaking them down into smaller, 
more manageable parts. Subqueries can also be used to retrieve data that will be used in the main query, 
allowing for more dynamic and flexible SQL statements.

Types of Subqueries:
1. Single-row subquery: Returns a single row and can be used with comparison operators.
2. Multiple-row subquery: Returns multiple rows and can be used with operators like IN, ANY, or ALL.
3. Scalar subquery: Returns a single value (one column, one row) and can be used in expressions.

Examples:

1. Single-row subquery:

   - Purpose: To find employees whose salary is greater than the average salary.
   
   SELECT EmployeeID, Name
   FROM Employees
   WHERE Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees); 
   
2. Multiple-row subquery:

Purpose: To find employees who work in departments with a budget greater than $100,000.

SELECT EmployeeID, Name
FROM Employees
WHERE DepartmentID IN (SELECT DepartmentID FROM Departments WHERE Budget > 100000);

3. Scalar subquery:

Purpose: To find the name of the employee with the highest salary.

SELECT Name
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary = (SELECT MAX(Salary) FROM Employees);

4. Correlated subquery:

Purpose: To find employees whose salary is above the average salary of their respective departments.

SELECT e.EmployeeID, e.Name
FROM Employees e
WHERE e.Salary > (SELECT AVG(Salary) FROM Employees WHERE DepartmentID = e.DepartmentID);

subqueries are a powerful feature in SQL that allow for more complex and dynamic queries by enabling the use 
of the results of one query within another. They can help simplify SQL statements and make them more readable 
and maintainable.

-- Example: Find students who scored above the average marks in their department.
SELECT s.student_name, m.marks_obtained, d.department_name
FROM students s
JOIN marks m ON s.student_id = m.student_id
JOIN department d ON s.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE m.marks_obtained > (SELECT AVG(marks_obtained) 
                           FROM marks m2 
                           JOIN students s2 ON m2.student_id = s2.student_id 
                           WHERE s2.department_id = d.department_id);
                           

-- 4. Using IN Operator
-- The IN operator allows you to specify multiple values in a WHERE clause.
-- Example: Find students who scored in the top 10 marks in any subject.
SELECT s.student_name, m.marks_obtained
FROM students s
JOIN marks m ON s.student_id = m.student_id
WHERE m.marks_obtained IN (SELECT marks_obtained 
                            FROM marks 
                            ORDER BY marks_obtained DESC 
                            LIMIT 10);


-- 5. Using EXISTS Operator
-- The EXISTS operator checks for the existence of rows returned by a subquery.
-- Example: Find faculty members who have students with low marks.
SELECT f.faculty_name
FROM faculty f
WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 
              FROM students s 
              JOIN marks m ON s.student_id = m.student_id 
              WHERE s.faculty_id = f.faculty_id AND m.marks_obtained < 40);


-- 6. Using ANY Operator
-- The ANY operator compares a value to each value returned by the subquery and 
-- returns true if any comparison is true.
-- Example: Find students who scored more than any student in a specific department.
SELECT s.student_name, m.marks_obtained
FROM students s
JOIN marks m ON s.student_id = m.student_id
WHERE m.marks_obtained > ANY (SELECT m2.marks_obtained 
                               FROM marks m2 
                               JOIN students s2 ON m2.student_id = s2.student_id 
                               WHERE s2.department_id = 'Computer Science');


-- 7. Using ALL Operator
-- The ALL operator compares a value to all values returned by the subquery and 
-- returns true if the comparison is true for all values.
-- Example: Find students who scored more than all students in a specific subject.
SELECT s.student_name, m.marks_obtained
FROM students s
JOIN marks m ON s.student_id = m.student_id
WHERE m.marks_obtained > ALL (SELECT m2.marks_obtained 
                               FROM marks m2 
                               WHERE m2.subject_name = 'Mathematics');
